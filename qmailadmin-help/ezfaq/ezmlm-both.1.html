ezmlm-both(1)                                       ezmlm-both(1)

<H2>NAME</H2>
       ezmlm-both - Creates a mailing list and digest list

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-both</b> <i>dir</i> <i>dot</i> <i>local</i> <i>host</i> <i>digestcode</i> <i>[</i> <i>address</i> <i>]</i>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-both</b> is a shell script to serve as an example of how
       easy it is to create  complete  specialized  setups  using
       components of <b><A HREF="ezmlm.5.html">ezmlm(5)</A></b>.

       <b>ezmlm-both</b>  invokes <b><A HREF="ezmlm-make.1.html">ezmlm-make(1)</A></b> to create a mailing list
       with digest enabled.

       If <i>address</i> is given, <b>ezmlm-both</b> sets  up  the  lists  with
       remote  administration  and installs <i>address</i> as the remote
       administrator. messages  to  <i>list</i>-owner  and  <i>list-digest</i>-
       owner  are  directed  to  <i>address</i>.  <i>address</i> is also made a
       subscriber of both lists.

       Posts to the list are restricted  to  subscribers  of  the
       list, the digest list, or addresses added with:

         % ezmlm-sub dir/extra address@host address2@host2 ...

       Other  posts  are rejected. If <i>address</i> is specified, posts
       from non-subscribers are sent to the remote  administrator
       for  moderation,  instead  of  being  ignored.  The remote
       administrator may accept the message or reject it. If  the
       remote  administrator  ignores the moderation request, the
       post will be ignored. The sender will not be  notified  in
       this case.

       If you are not the user receiving mail, you need to change
       ownership of <i>dir</i>  and  its  contents  to  the  controlling
       user/group.
