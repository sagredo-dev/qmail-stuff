<H2>NAME</H2>
       ezmlm - format of ezmlm directory

<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>
       An <b>ezmlm</b> directory, <i>dir</i>, stores information about an <b>ezmlm</b>
       mailing  list.   <b>ezmlm-make</b>  creates  <i>dir</i>;  <b>ezmlm-sub</b>  and
       <b>ezmlm-unsub</b>  manipulate  the  subscriber list stored under
       <i>dir</i>; <b>ezmlm-manage</b> handles administrative requests automat-
       ically;  <b>ezmlm-send</b>  sends  a  message  to all subscribers
       listed in <i>dir</i> and also maintains  a  message  archive  and
       message  subject index if the list is configured to do so.
       <b>ezmlm-reject</b> rejects messages that have an empty  subject,
       or  a  subject  consisting  of only a command word; <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>return</b> handles bounces; <b>ezmlm-warn</b> warns users  for  which
       messages  bounce and eventually removes them from the sub-
       scriber list.  <b>ezmlm-idx</b> can create a subject  index  from
       an  existing  list  archive.   <b>ezmlm-get</b>  manages message,
       index, and thread retrieval from the archive, as  well  as
       the  generation  of message digests; <b>ezmlm-cron</b> provides a
       restricted interface to cron for the generation of  digest
       generation  trigger  messages; <b>ezmlm-store</b> queues messages
       of moderated lists and sends a moderation request  to  the
       moderator(s); <b>ezmlm-moderate</b> processes moderation requests
       to accept the queued message to the list  via  <b>ezmlm-send,</b>
       or to return the message to the sender; <b>ezmlm-clean</b> cleans
       up the moderation queue and returns to the sender any mes-
       sages  that have timed-out; <b>ezmlm-gate</b> posts messages that
       come from a SENDER  in  an  address  database,  and  sends
       remaining messages out for moderation; <b>ezmlm-check</b> is used
       to diagnose problems with ezmlm  mailing  list  configura-
       tion;  <b>ezmlm-issub</b>  and <b>ezmlm-issubn</b> determine if a SENDER
       is a subscriber or a member of a collection of  addresses;
       <b>ezmlm-tstdig</b>  determines  if  it  is  time to create a new
       digest based on the number and volume of messages and  the
       amount  of  time that has passed since the last digest was
       issued; <b>ezmlm-request</b> can be used to answer <b>ezmlm</b> commands
       in  the  subject  line easing migration from other mailing
       list managers. It can also function as a global  interface
       mimicking  the  interface  of  other mailing list manager.
       <b>ezmlm-glmake</b> can set up the global interface,  and  <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>glconf</b>  can  create  a  configuration  file for the global
       interface from your lists.

<H2>SUBSCRIBERS</H2>
       <i>dir</i><b>/subscribers</b> is a directory containing  the  subscriber
       list.    <b>ezmlm-manage</b>  allows  automatic  subscription  if
       <i>dir</i><b>/public</b> exists.

       The list is hashed into 53 files, named  <b>@</b>  through  <b>t</b>  in
       ASCII.  A nonexistent file is treated as an empty file.

       Each  file contains a series of addresses.  An address can
       be any string of non-NUL characters up to 400 bytes  long.
       Each address is preceded by the letter T and followed by a

                                                                1

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

       NUL.

       For reliability, when an address is added  to  or  removed
       from  the  mailing  list,  the  relevant file is recreated
       under a temporary name  inside  <i>dir</i><b>/subscribers</b>  and  then
       moved into place.

       <i>dir</i><b>/key</b>  is  a  binary file.  <b>ezmlm-manage</b> uses <i>dir</i><b>/key</b> to
       create confirmation numbers.  Anyone  who  can  guess  the
       contents  of  <i>dir</i><b>/key</b>  can  forge  subscription  requests.
       <b>ezmlm-make</b> does not put much effort  into  making  <i>dir</i><b>/key</b>
       difficult  to  guess;  for better security, you should add
       some random garbage to <i>dir</i><b>/key</b>.

<H2>ARCHIVE</H2>
       <i>dir</i><b>/archive</b> is a directory containing messages  previously
       sent to subscribers.  <b>ezmlm-send</b> archives all new messages
       if <i>dir</i><b>/archived</b> exists. If <i>dir</i><b>/indexed</b> exists,  <b>ezmlm-send</b>
       also maintains a message subject and author index.

       Messages  sent  to  the  mailing  list are numbered from 1
       upwards, whether or not they are archived.  <i>dir</i><b>/num</b> is the
       number  of  messages sent so far followed by ':', followed
       by the cumulative amount of message body that  has  passed
       <b>ezmlm-send</b> stored as kbytes * 4 (4 corresponds to 1kb).

       <i>dir</i><b>/archive</b>  has subdirectories, each subdirectory storing
       up to 100 messages.  Message number 100m+n, with n between
       0 and 99, is stored in <i>dir</i><b>/archive/</b><i>m</i><b>/</b><i>n</i>.  For example, mes-
       sage number 15307 is stored  in  <i>dir</i><b>/archive/153/07</b>.   The
       message index is stored in the file <b>index</b> in the same sub-
       directory of <i>dir</i><b>/archive</b> holding  the  corresponding  mes-
       sages.   Thus,  the  subject  index  contains  up  to  100
       entries.

       The subject index contains message subjects that are  nor-
       malized  so that the original message and all replies have
       the same entry. The subject index  is  used  for  advanced
       message retrieval functions. For safety, the subject index
       is created under a temporary name inside  <i>dir</i><b>/archive</b>  and
       then moved into place.

       <b>ezmlm-manage</b>  will ignore message files without the owner-
       execute bit set.  <b>ezmlm-send</b> turns  on  the  owner-execute
       bit after safely writing the message to disk.

       <b>ezmlm-make</b>  by  default  adds  <b>ezmlm-get</b> to <i>dir</i><b>/manager</b> to
       handle <i>-get,</i> <i>-index,</i> and <i>-thread</i> requests.  If  <b>ezmlm-make</b>
       is  invoked  with  a <i>digcode</i> command line argument, digest
       creation is enabled by putting this argument on the <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>get</b> command line.

<H2>BOUNCES</H2>
       <i>dir</i><b>/bounce</b>  is  a  directory  containing  bounce messages.

                                                                2

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

       <b>ezmlm-return</b> stores several types of files here.

<H2>DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-make</b> sets up four  files  to  control  mailing  list
       deliveries.   Each  file  is a series of delivery instruc-
       tions in <b>dot-qmail</b> format.

       <i>dir</i><b>/editor</b>  handles  incoming  mailing  list  submissions.
       <b>ezmlm-make</b>  sets  up  <i>dir</i><b>/editor</b>  to  invoke <b>ezmlm-send</b> to
       immediately forward each message to  all  subscribers  and
       then to run <b>ezmlm-warn</b>.

       <i>dir</i><b>/owner</b> handles incoming messages for the mailing list's
       owner.  <b>ezmlm-make</b> sets up <i>dir</i><b>/owner</b> to store messages  in
       <i>dir</i><b>/Mailbox</b> and then to run <b>ezmlm-warn</b>.

       <i>dir</i><b>/bouncer</b>  handles incoming bounce messages.  <b>ezmlm-make</b>
       sets up <i>dir</i><b>/bouncer</b> to invoke <b>ezmlm-return</b>.  <b>ezmlm-warn</b> is
       no  longer  invoked here due to the load it places on sys-
       tems with many large lists with many bounces.

       <i>dir</i><b>/manager</b>  handles  incoming  administrative   requests.
       <b>ezmlm-make</b> sets up <i>dir</i><b>/manager</b> to invoke <b>ezmlm-get</b>, <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>manage</b>, and then <b>ezmlm-warn</b>.

       <i>dir</i><b>/moderator</b> handles incoming message <i>accept</i>  and  <i>reject</i>
       requests for moderated lists.  <b>ezmlm-make</b> sets up <i>dir</i><b>/mod-</b>
       <b>erator</b> to invoke <b>ezmlm-moderate</b>, and .BR ezmlm-clean .

<H2>DIGESTS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-get</b> can create digests if it  is  invoked  from  the
       command  line,  from <i>dir</i><b>/editor</b>, or from <i>dir</i><b>/manager</b>.  The
       program functions in slightly different ways  in  these  3
       settings (see <b><A HREF="ezmlm-get.1.html">ezmlm-get(1)</A></b>).

       To  enable  automatic  digests for a mailing list, use the
       <b>ezmlm-make</b> <b>-d</b> switch. To also  enable  the  generation  of
       digests  at specific times dictated by mailed trigger mes-
       sages, a <i>digcode</i> should be specified on the <b>ezmlm-get</b> com-
       mand  line.   This  can be done by specifying <i>digcode</i> as a
       fifth argument to <b>ezmlm-make</b> when  setting  up  the  list.
       <i>digcode</i> must be alphanumeric and is case-insensitive.

       To  generate  trigger  messages,  use  <b><A HREF="ezmlm-cron.1.html">ezmlm-cron(1)</A></b> as an
       interface to <b><A HREF="crond.8.html">crond(8)</A></b> or use <b>crond</b> directly.

       <i>dir</i><b>/num</b> contains the number of the last message processed,
       followed  by  ':'  and a number that is increased by 1 for
       each 256 bytes of message body text processed. The  latter
       number  is  used  by  <b>ezmlm-tstdig</b>  to  determine if a new
       digest is due.

       <i>dir</i><b>/dignum</b> contains the contents of <i>dir</i><b>/num</b> at the time of
       the  last  regular  digest  creation,  followed  by a ':',

                                                                3

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

       followed by a timestamp.  It is updated after each regular
       digest is sent.

       <i>dir</i><b>/digissue</b> contains the issue number of the last regular
       digest. It is incremented for each regular digest sent.

       The following user crontab entry (all on one line)  gener-
       ates  a  digest of the list <i>list@host.domain</i> at 1600 every
       day:

         00 16 * * * /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject list-dig.digcode

       Alternatively, <b>ezmlm-cron</b> can be used:

         % ezmlm-cron -t 16:00 list@host digcode

       <b>ezmlm-get</b>  can  also  be run from the shell: To generate a
       digest  to  <i>list-digest@host</i>  from  the  list  housed   in
       <i>~joe/list</i>:

         % ezmlm-get ~joe/list

       Like  other  <b>ezmlm-get</b> replies, digest can be sent in sev-
       eral formats. See <b><A HREF="ezmlm-get.1.html">ezmlm-get(1)</A></b> for more info.

<H2>MODERATION</H2>
       There are  three  aspects  of  moderation:  moderation  of
       posts,  moderation  of subscriptions, and "remote adminis-
       tration", i.e. giving the moderator the right to  (un)sub-
       scribe  any user.  <b>ezmlm</b> handles these three aspects sepa-
       rately. The two first aspects enhance security, while  the
       third  decreases  security,  but makes list administration
       considerably easier. By default, the moderator database is
       the  same  for all three functions. While "remote adminis-
       tration" and subscription moderation always use  the  same
       database,  the  moderators  for  message moderation can be
       different.

       Even with subscription moderation, the user has to  verify
       the  request.  This  is to ensure that the user initiating
       the request really  controls  the  address.   <b>ezmlm-manage</b>
       options  exist to disable the user handshake, which may be
       useful in some circumstances.

       For moderation options, the moderators are by stored in  a
       subscriber  list in <i>moddir</i><b>/subscribers</b>.  By default <i>moddir</i>
       is <i>dir</i><b>/mod</b>.

       Moderators can be added and removed with:

       <b>ezmlm-sub</b> <i>moddir</i> <i>moderator@host</i>

       <b>ezmlm-unsub</b> <i>moddir</i> <i>moderator@host</i>

                                                                4

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

       For subscription moderation, touch <i>dir</i><b>/modsub</b> after adding
       moderator(s).     For    remote    administration,   touch
       <i>dir</i><b>/remote</b>.  If the contents of these files start  with  a
       leading  forward  slash,  it  is assumed to be the name of
       <b>moddir</b> subscription moderation. If both  files  exist  and
       start  with  a  forward slash, the <i>dir</i><b>/remote</b> contents are
       ignored. Moderators are stored in a subscriber list in the
       <b>subscribers</b> subdirectory of <b>moddir</b>.  If no directory names
       are specified, the default,  <i>dir</i><b>/mod</b>,  is  used.   In  all
       cases,  the <i>subscribers</i> subdirectory of the base directory
       must exists/be created.

       Moderation of messages is achieved by creating <i>dir</i><b>/modpost</b>
       and   modifying  <i>dir</i><b>/editor</b> to invoke <b>ezmlm-store.</b>  <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>store</b> stores the message in <i>dir</i><b>/mod/pending</b>  and  sends  a
       moderation request to all moderators stored in <i>moddir</i>.

       If  <i>dir</i><b>/modpost</b> does not exist, <b>ezmlm-store</b> posts messages
       directly, and <b>ezmlm-clean</b> does nothing.

       If <i>dir</i><b>/modpost</b> contains a directory name starting  with  a
       forward  slash,  this directory is used as <i>moddir</i> for mes-
       sage moderation.  Moderators are stored  in  a  subscriber
       list  in  the  <i>subscribers</i>  subdirectory of <i>moddir</i>.  If no
       directory names are specified, the  default,  <i>dir</i><b>/mod</b>,  is
       used.

       <i>dir</i><b>/moderator</b>   is   linked   to   <i>dot</i><b>-accept-default</b>  and
       <i>dot</i><b>-reject-default</b>.  It handles replies from  the  modera-
       tors.

       In   addition   to   a  moderator  list,  the  directories
       <i>dir</i><b>/mod/pending</b>,  <i>dir</i><b>/mod/accepted</b>,  and  <i>dir</i><b>/mod/rejected</b>
       must  exist. These directories contain the message modera-
       tion queue.

       If <i>dir</i><b>/mod/modtime</b> it determines the minimal time in hours
       that  messages  wait  in the moderation queue, before they
       are returned to sender with the message  in  <i>dir</i><b>/text/mod-</b>
       <b>timeout</b>.

       If  a <i>-help</i> command is send for a moderator and <i>dir</i><b>/modsub</b>
       or <i>dir</i><b>/remote</b> exist, a more detailed help  message  stored
       in  <i>dir</i><b>/text/mod-help</b> will be sent together with the regu-
       lar help.  This  text  should  not  contain  secrets.   If
       <i>dir</i><b>/text/mod-help</b>  does  not  exist, <i>dir</i><b>/text/help</b> will be
       sent.

       If a <i>-list</i> command is sent for a moderator and  <i>dir</i><b>/modsub</b>
       or  <i>dir</i><b>/remote</b> exist, and the <b>ezmlm-manage</b> <b>-l</b> command line
       switch is specified, a subscriber list will be returned.

       If an <i>-edit.file</i> command  is  sent  for  a  moderator  and
       <i>dir</i><b>/remote</b>  exist,  and  the  <b>ezmlm-manage</b> <b>-d</b> command line

                                                                5

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

       switch is specified, <b>text/file</b> is returned  together  with
       an  <b>ezmlm</b>  cookie.  The remote administrator may return an
       edited version of the file, which will be stored, provided
       that  the  cookie  is valid.  See <b><A HREF="ezmlm-manage.1.html">ezmlm-manage(1)</A></b> for more
       info.

<H2>TEXT</H2>
       <i>dir</i><b>/text</b> is a  directory  containing  files  sent  out  by
       <b>ezmlm-manage</b> in response to administrative requests:

       <b>top</b>            Introducing  <b>ezmlm</b>.   This is placed at the
                      top of each response.

       <b>bottom</b>         Explaining  how  to  use  <b>ezmlm</b>.   This  is

                      number.

       <b>get-bad</b>        Rejecting a bad archive retrieval  request.

       <b>digest</b>         Text  copied  into the <i>Administrativia</i> sec-
                      tion of the digest. Usually, this will con-
                      tain  subscription  info for the digest, as
                      well as information on how to post  to  the
                      list.

       <b>trailer</b>        If  this  files exists, it is copied to the
                      end of all messages to the list.

       <b>faq</b>            Sent in response to the <i>faq</i>  command.  Usu-
                      ally  contains  frequently  asked questions
                      and answers specific for the mailing  list.

                                                                6

       <b>info</b>           Sent  in response to the <i>info</i> command. Usu-
                      ally contains a descripition, policy,  etc,
                      for  the  list.  The  first  line should in
                      itself be a very brief description  of  the
                      list.

       <b>bounce-warn</b>    Pointing out that messages have bounced.

       <b>bounce-probe</b>   Pointing  out  that  a  warning message has
                      bounced.

       <b>bounce-num</b>     Explaining that  <b>ezmlm-return</b>  has  kept  a
                      list of bounced message numbers.

       <b>dig-bounce-num</b> Explaining   that   digest   messages  have
                      bounced. All other text files are used  for
                      both the main list and the digest list.

       <b>bounce-bottom</b>  Separating the bounce message.

       <b>mod-help</b>       is  set  to list moderators issuing a <i>-help</i>
                      command. It contains instructions for  mod-
                      erators, but it is relatively trivial for a
                      non-moderator to read it. Don't put secrets
                      here.

       <b>mod-reject</b>     is the returned to the sender of a rejected
                      post.

       <b>mod-timeout</b>    is returned if the message timed-out  with-
                      out moderator action.

       <b>mod-sub</b>        is  added  to the text confirming subscrip-
                      tion and unsubscription instead  of  <b>bottom</b>
                      and  the  requesting  message,  for actions
                      that were  approved  by  a  moderator.  Not
                      copying  the  requesting  message hides the
                      moderator identity from the subscriber.

       <b>mod-request</b>    is the  text  sent  to  the  moderators  to
                      request  moderator  action on a posted mes-
                      sage.

       <b>mod-unsub-confirm</b>
                      Requesting that  the  moderator  confirm  a
                      request  to  subscribe.   If this file does
                      not exist, <b>sub-confirm</b> will be used.

       <b>mod-unsub-confirm</b>
                      Requesting that  the  moderator  confirm  a
                      request  to unsubscribe.  If this file does
                      not exist, <b>unsub-confirm</b> will be used.

       <b>edit-do</b>        Instructions    sent    to    the    remote

                                                                7

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

                      administrator  together  with  a  copy of a
                      <i>dir</i><b>/text</b> file and editing instructions.

       <b>edit-list</b>      A list of editable files in <i>dir</i><b>/text</b> with a
                      one-line   description  send  to  a  remote
                      administrator in response to a  <i>-edit</i>  com-
                      mand.

       <b>edit-done</b>      Sent  to  the remote administrator after an
                      edited <i>dir</i><b>/text</b> file has been  successfully
                      saved.

       Several  tags in the text files are replaced by ezmlm pro-
       grams.  All programs replace the tag <b>&lt;#l#&gt;</b> with  the  name
       of  the  list  or  the list-digest, as appropriate for the
       request, and <b>&lt;#h#&gt;</b> with the hostname for the list.  <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>send</b>  and <b>ezmlm-get</b> replace <b>&lt;#n#&gt;</b> with the current message
       number in added headers from <i>dir</i><b>/headeradd</b> and text files.
       <b>ezmlm-get</b> does this for digest messages, where the current
       message is the number of the first message in the  digest.
       <b>ezmlm-manage</b>  replaces  the  tag  <b>&lt;#A#&gt;</b> anywhere on a line
       with the subscription address, and  <b>&lt;#R#&gt;</b>  anywhere  on  a
       line  with  the address the subscriber must reply to. Only
       the first tag on any line is processed.

       For backwards  compatibility,  <b>ezmlm-manage</b>  replaces  the
       line  <b>!A</b>  in  any of these files with the name of the sub-
       scription address.  It replaces the line <b>!R</b> in <b>sub-confirm</b>
       and  <b>unsub-confirm</b>  with  the  address that the subscriber
       must reply to.

       <b>ezmlm-store</b> replaces the tag <b>&lt;#A#&gt;</b> anywhere on a line with
       the  address for accepting the message, and <b>&lt;#R#&gt;</b> anywhere
       on a line with the  address  for  rejecting  the  message.
       Only the first tag on any line is processed.

       For backwards compatibility, <b>ezmlm-store</b> also replaces the
       line <b>!A</b> with the address for accepting the message and the
       line <b>!R</b> with the address for rejecting the message.

<H2>OUTGOING MESSAGE EDITING</H2>
       <i>dir</i><b>/headerremove</b>  is a list of bad header field names, one
       per line.  <b>ezmlm-send</b> removes these header fields from all
       outgoing messages.  <b>ezmlm-make</b> sets up <i>dir</i><b>/headerremove</b> to
       remove  <b>Return-Path</b>,  <b>Return-Receipt-To</b>,  and  <b>Return-Path</b>
       fields.

       <i>dir</i><b>/headeradd</b>  is a list of new header fields.  <b>ezmlm-send</b>
       adds these fields to every outgoing  message.   <b>ezmlm-send</b>
       sets  up <i>dir</i><b>/headeradd</b> to add <b>X-No-Archive:</b> <b>yes</b> and <b>Prece-</b>
       <b>dence:</b>bulk<b>.</b>

       If <i>dir</i><b>/mimeremove</b> exists, <b>ezmlm-send</b>  removed  parts  with
       the   corresponding   content-types  from  composite  MIME

                                                                8

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

       messages. If the <b>ezmlm-reject</b> <i>dir</i> argument  is  specified,
       simple  MIME messages of these content-types are rejected.

       If <i>dir</i><b>/mimereject</b> exists, and the <b>ezmlm-reject</b>  <i>dir</i>  argu-
       ment  is specified, simple MIME messages of these content-
       types, or composite MIME messages with any  body  part  of
       these content-types are rejected.

       If  <i>dir</i><b>/sequence</b>  exists,  the  first  line  is added as a
       header to all outgoing messages, followed by a  space  and
       the  message  number.  The  message  number  is useful for
       archive retrievals, since some mail systems do not  reveal
       the  return-path  to  the user.  <b>NOTE:</b> Sublists have their
       own message counter. Adding a sequence header from a  sub-
       lists  will  give  you the sublist message number which is
       different from the main list message number.

       <i>dir</i><b>/prefix</b> is a subject prefix. If this file  exists,  its
       contents  are  prefixed  to the subject of the post in the
       outgoing message. The archived message is  not  processed.
       Attempts  are  made to not duplicate an existing prefix in
       replies.  Think twice before using this option.  A  prefix
       takes  unnecessary space on the subject line and most mail
       clients can easily filter on other headers, such as 'Mail-
       ing-List:'. If <i>dir</i><b>/prefix</b> <b>contains</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>'#',</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b>
       <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> number. The use of this feature
       is  inadvisable and violates internet mail standards. How-
       ever, it is very popular in e.g. Japan. If  you  must  use
       this  feature,  make  sure  you  are aware that you may be
       causing problems to users, sublists, etc.

       <i>dir</i><b>/text/trailer</b>  is  a  message  trailer.  If  this  file
       exists,  it's  contents  are copied to the end of outgoing
       messages. Only lines terminated with new-line are  copied.
       No  trailer  is copied to the archived version of the mes-
       sage.

<H2>MISCELLANY</H2>
       The first line of  <i>dir</i><b>/mailinglist</b>  is  a  line  of  text.
       <b>ezmlm-send</b>  creates  a new <b>Mailing-List</b> field, showing the
       contents of <i>dir</i><b>/mailinglist</b>, in every outgoing message.

       The first lines of <i>dir</i><b>/outlocal</b> and <i>dir</i><b>/outhost</b>  give  the
       outgoing  name  of  the  mailing  list.  These are used by
       <b>ezmlm-manage</b> and <b>ezmlm-send</b> to construct sender  addresses
       for outgoing messages.

       The  first  lines  of  <i>dir</i><b>/inlocal</b> and <i>dir</i><b>/inhost</b> give the
       incoming name of the mailing  list.   These  are  used  by
       <b>ezmlm-manage</b>  to parse incoming envelopes.  Normally <i>inlo-</i>
       <i>cal</i> and <i>inhost</i> are the same as <i>outlocal</i> and  <i>outhost</i>,  but
       sometimes  they  are different, with <i>outlocal</i><b>@</b><i>outhost</i> for-
       warded to <i>inlocal</i><b>@</b><i>inhost</i>.

                                                                9

ezmlm(5)                                                 ezmlm(5)

       If <i>dir</i><b>/sublist</b> exists, this mailing  list  is  a  sublist,
       redistributing  messages  from a parent mailing list.  The
       first line of <i>dir</i><b>/sublist</b> is the name of the parent  list.
       This affects the behavior of <b>ezmlm-send</b>.

       If   <i>dir</i><b>/msgsize</b>   exists,   it   is  assumed  to  contain
       ``max:min'', where ``max'' is the maximum size in bytes of
       an  acceptable message body, and ``min'' the corresponding
       minimal size. Either will be ignored if zero  or  omitted.
       If the <b>ezmlm-reject</b> command line specifies the list direc-
       tory, messages not meeting the size criteria are rejected.

       If <i>dir</i><b>/charset</b> exists, the first line is assumed to repre-
       sent a valid MIME character set, which  is  used  for  all
       outgoing  MIME  messages sent by <b>ezmlm-get</b> and the message
       moderation programs. The character set string may be  suf-
       fixed  with  ':'  and 'Q' or 'B' to send all outgoing text
       (ezmlm  messages,  digest  table-of-contents,   moderation
       requests,   etc)   encoded   in   ``Quoted-Printable''  or
       ``base64'' encoding. By  default,  no  encoding  is  done,
       which  may  result  in the transmission of characters with
       the high bit set. When encoding is specified, trigger mes-
       sages  and  other  parts  of  the reply that should not be
       encoded are sent as separate MIME parts.

       <i>dir</i><b>/lock</b> is an empty file.   Any  program  that  reads  or
       writes  the  subscriber  list,  or  adds  messages  to the
       archive, locks <i>dir</i><b>/lock</b>.

       <i>dir</i><b>/Log</b> is an advisory log of subscription and unsubscrip-
       tion  actions.  <b>WARNING:</b> <b>Log</b> is not protected against sys-
       tem crashes.  Log entries may be missing or  corrupted  if
       the  system goes down. There is Log for each of the acces-
       sory address databases as well. Thus, the log  for  digest
       subscribers is <i>dir</i><b>/digest/Log</b>.  If enabled, these logs can
       be retrieved  by  remote  administrators  (see  <b>ezmlm-man-</b>
       <b><A HREF="age.1.html">age(1)</A></b>).

       <i>dir</i><b>/digest</b> contains items specific for the digest list.

       <i>dir</i><b>/digest/subscribers</b>  contains hash files of digest sub-
       scriber addresses.

       <i>dir</i><b>/digest/Log</b>, <i>dir</i><b>/digest/bounce</b>,  <i>dir</i><b>/digest/lockbounce</b>,
       and  <i>dir</i><b>/digest/lock</b>  have  functions  for the digest list
       that mirror that of the corresponding files in <i>dir</i>.

       <i>dir</i><b>/sql</b> contains SQL server access  information  for  list
       that are configured to use an SQL database for storage.

       <i>dir</i><b>/tstdig</b>  is  a timestamp used temporarily by <b>ezmlm-tst-</b>
       <b><A HREF="dig.1.html">dig(1)</A></b> to coordinate digesting.

                                                               10
