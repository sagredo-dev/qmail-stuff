ezmlmsubrc(5)                                       ezmlmsubrc(5)

<H2>NAME</H2>
       ezmlmsubrc - set up a minimal sublist

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-make</b> <b>-C</b> <b>ezmlmsubrc</b> <b>-options</b> <i>dir</i> <i>dot</i> <i>local</i> <i>host</i>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       <b>ezmlmglrc</b>  instructs <b><A HREF="ezmlm-make.1.html">ezmlm-make(1)</A></b> to create <i>dir</i> and files
       within it to support the <i>local</i><b>@</b><i>host</i> sublist.  The  sublist
       handles bounces, but not subscriptions. It is intended for
       creation of sublists that are part of an SQL database sup-
       ported  distributed  ezmlm  list.  For creation of regular
       sublists, use <b><A HREF="ezmlm-make.1.html">ezmlm-make(1)</A></b> with <b><A HREF="ezmlmrc.5.html">ezmlmrc(5)</A></b>.

<H2>REQUIRED SWITCHES</H2>
       While these switches can be omitted,  the  list  will  not
       function unless they are specified.

       <b>-3</b> <i>mainlocal</i>
              Local  name of the main list for which this list is
              a sublist. If the sublist is a sublist for digests,
              <i>mainlocal</i>  should  refer  to  the  mail  list, i.e.
              stripped of ``-digest''. This is required in  order
              for  the  bounce  texts  to  refer  to  the correct
              archive. Use the <b>-d</b> switch!

       <b>-4</b> <i>mainhost</i>
              Host name of the main list for which this list is a
              sublist.

       <b>-6</b> <i>host:port:user:pass:db:table</i>
              SQL  connect  info.  Specifies the host and port to
              connect to, the user/password to use, the  database
              name,  and  the root table name.  The host defaults
              to  ``localhost'',  the  database  and   table   to
              ``ezmlm''.  The port default is the default for the
              particular SQL server type used. For sublists  dis-
              seminating   a   digest,   ``table''  will  end  in
              ``_digest''.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
       <b>-d</b>     This sublist is a sublist of a digest list.  The <b>-3</b>
              argment  used  should be the local name of the main
              list, rather than the digest list, i.e. the  termi-
              nal ``-digest'' should be stripped.

       <b>-5</b> <i>owner</i>
              The  address  to  which  to  redirect  mail send to
              <i>local-</i><b>owner@</b><i>host</i>.  The default is the owner address
              for the main list.

<H2>USAGE</H2>
       A  common  task  is  to create both a sublist for the main
       list and a sublist for the corresponding digest. Note that

                                                                1

ezmlmsubrc(5)                                       ezmlmsubrc(5)

       the  local  list  names  are given as is, whereas the main
       list name always refers to the main list itself  (and  not
       its  digest).  The main list is  ``mainloc@mainhost'', the
       local sublist is ``me-sub1@myhost''; the  main  digest  is
       ``mainloc-digest@mainhost''  and  the local digest sublist
       is ``me-sub1-digest@myhost''.

       ezmlm-make -Cezmlmsubrc -3 mainloc -4  mainhost  -6  main-
       host::user:pw:db:tab ~/DIR ~me/.qmail-sub1 me-sub1 myhost

       ezmlm-make -Cezmlmsubrc -d -3 mainloc -4 mainhost -6 main-
       host::user:pw:db:tab -d ~/DIR  ~me/.qmail-sub1-digest  me-
       sub1-digest myhost
