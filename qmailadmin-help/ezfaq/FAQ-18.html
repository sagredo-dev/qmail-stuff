<H2><A NAME="s18">18. Ezmlm-idx compile time options.</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.1">18.1 Location of binaries.</A>
</H2>

<P>This is configured via <B>conf-bin</B> as for other ezmlm programs.
The default is <B>/usr/local/bin/ezmlm</B>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.2">18.2 Location of man pages.</A>
</H2>

<P>This is configured via <B>conf-man</B> as for other ezmlm programs.
The default is <B>/usr/local/man</B>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.3">18.3 Base directory of qmail-installation.</A>
</H2>

<P>This is configured via <B>conf-qmail</B> as for other ezmlm programs.
The default is <B>/var/qmail</B>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.4">18.4 Short header texts, etc.</A>
</H2>

<P>Ezmlm-idx text (short lines, such as ``Administrivia'' for
digests), command names, etc, are defined in <B>idx.h</B>, used at
compile time. You can change them by changing the defines in
this file.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.5">18.5 Arbitrary limits.</A>
</H2>

<P><B>idx.h</B> contains defines for some ezmlm-idx arbitrary limits,
such as the maximum number of messages per ``-get'' request. They
can be changed here.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.6">18.6 Command names.</A>
</H2>

<P>There is support for one alias per user command for internationalization.
(See 
<A HREF="FAQ-19.html#language">Multiple language support</A>.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.7">18.7 Error messages.</A>
</H2>

<P>All ezmlm-idx error messages are defines in <B>errtxt.h</B>, used at
compile time. These can be changed for special situations, but
we would advise against doing so. If you do for some reason
produce such a translated file, we would appreciate if you
sent a copy to the authors. NOTE: These do not affect error
messages from programs that are not part of the ezmlm-idx
package, nor of some subroutines used by
ezmlm-idx programs (getconf_line.c comes to mind).
<P>Hopefully, the error messages for all parts will be
synchronized in later versions of ezmlm, and possibly handled
from a run-time changeable separate file (maybe as a .cdb
database).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss18.8">18.8 Paths and other odd configuration items.</A>
</H2>

<P>idx.h also has defines for <B>/etc/ezmlmrc</B>, default formats for
moderation enclosures, default character set, default digest
format, etc. Since most of these items are easily changed at
run time, there is usually no need to change the compiled-in
defaults. If you do need to, this is where they are.
