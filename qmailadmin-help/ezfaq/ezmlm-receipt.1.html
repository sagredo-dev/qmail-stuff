<H2>NAME</H2>
       ezmlm-receipt - handle sublist replies at the main list

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-receipt</b> [ <b>-dD</b> ] <i>dir</i>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>  handles mail from sublists of the main list
       stored in <i>dir</i> and,  if  it  exists,  the  associated  main
       digest  list.   <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>  is  used for main list with
       only sublists as subscribers. It is not useful for  normal
       mailing lists.

       <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>  is normally invoked from a <b>.qmail</b> file.  It
       reads a mail message from its standard input, and  a  mail
       envelope  from  the  <b>SENDER</b>,  <b>LOCAL</b>,  and <b>HOST</b> environment
       variables.

       <b>ezmlm-receipt</b> has two functions. It  takes  the  place  of
       <b><A HREF="ezmlm-receipt.1.html">ezmlm-receipt(1)</A></b> for main lists that have only sublists as
       subscribers.  Bounces do not lead to removal of the bounc-
       ing address.  <b>emzlm-receipt</b> saves the bounce, and logs the
       event to the  mail  log.   <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>  also  saves  the
       bounce  to  <i>dir</i><b>/bounce/dnnn.ppp</b>  where <b>nnn</b> is a time stamp
       and <b>ppp</b> the PID of the process. A maximum  of  50  bounces
       are  saved.  Further  bounces  are discarded until room is
       made in the bounce directory by manually  removing  files.
       If  the  list uses and SQL database, the even is logged to
       the _mlog table instead,  and  only  if  the  distribution
       cookie  matches. The bounce is still saved, but only if it
       contained a matching distribution cookie.

       <b>ezmlm-receipt</b> also handles feedback messages from the sub-
       list.  These  are used to monitor that the sublist is able
       to send out messages.  Receipt  of  feedback  messages  is
       logged  to  the  mail  log.   If  the  list  uses  and SQL
       database, the even is logged to the _mlog  table  instead,
       and only if the distribution cookie matches.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
       <b>-d</b>     <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>  will  assume  the  message  is for a
              digest list.  Normally, <b>ezmlm-receipt</b> will  autode-
              tect  this  from  the bounce address. Autodetection
              makes  <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>  less  flexible  and  will  be
              removed in future versions.

       <b>-D</b>     <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>  will assume that the bounce is for a
              normal (non-digest) list.  Normally,  <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>
              will  autodetect  this  from  the  bounce  address.
              Autodetection makes <b>ezmlm-receipt</b> less flexible and
              will be removed in future versions.  <b>-D</b> will become
              the default.

                                                                1

<H2>ADDRESSES</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-receipt</b> handles mail sent to any  of  the  following
       addresses:

       <i>local</i><b>-return-</b>
              Trash.   A help message or subscription acknowledg-
              ment bounced.

       <i>local</i><b>-return-</b><i>msg</i><b>-</b><i>box</i><b>=</b><i>domain</i>
              Distribution bounce.  Message number <i>msg</i>  was  lost
              on the way to the sublist <i>box</i><b>@</b><i>domain</i>.

       <i>local</i><b>-return-</b><i>msg</i><b>-</b>
              Pre-VERP  distribution  bounce,  in  QSBMF  format.
              Message number <i>msg</i> was lost on the way  to  one  or
              more  sublists; <b>ezmlm-receipt</b> will parse the bounce
              to figure out the addresses.

       <i>local</i><b>-return-receipt</b>
              Feedback message  from  a  sublist.   <b>ezmlm-receipt</b>
              will  figure out message number and sublist address
              from the envelope sender.

              For all the above addresses if, <i>local</i>  is  followed
              by  <i>-digest</i>,  messages are assumed to relate to the
              digest list, and are  stored  in  <i>dir</i><b>/digest/bounce</b>
              rather than in <i>dir</i> <b>/bounce</b> <b>.</b>
