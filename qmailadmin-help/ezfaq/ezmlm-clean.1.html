ezmlm-clean(1)                                     ezmlm-clean(1)

<H2>NAME</H2>
       ezmlm-clean - clean moderation directory

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-clean</b> <b>[mMrRvV]</b> <i>dir</i>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       If  <i>dir</i><b>/modpost</b> exists, <b>ezmlm-clean</b> sends out messages for
       timed-out posts in the moderation  directory  and  removes
       stubs for rejected and accepted posts for the mailing list
       stored in <i>dir</i>.  If <i>dir</i><b>/modpost</b> does not exist, <b>ezmlm-clean</b>
       does nothing and exits.

       <b>ezmlm-clean</b>  reads  <i>dir</i><b>/modtime</b>  and  extracts  a time-out
       ``time'' in hours from it. If ``time'' is 0 or <i>dir</i><b>/modtime</b>
       is  empty or doesn't exist, a default of 120 h is used. If
       a time is given, it is limited to the range 24 h to 240 h.

       <b>ezmlm-clean</b>   then  looks  through  <i>dir</i><b>/mod/accepted/</b>  and
       <i>dir</i><b>/mod/rejected/</b> and removes  message  stubs  older  than
       ``time''.  ``Time'' is a minimum retention time. Since the
       files are processed only  when  <b>ezmlm-clean</b>  is  run,  the
       delay  before  a message is timed-out may be substantially
       longer if the list does not receive many messages.

       Message age determined by the time parsed  <i>from</i>  <i>the</i>  <i>file</i>
       <i>name,</i>  not from the creation time.  Thus, there is no good
       way to extend the life of the file by  e.g.  touching  it.
       Also,  files  in these directories are not checked for the
       proper format.  Thus,  most  non-message  files  in  these
       directories  will be deleted the first time <b>ezmlm-clean</b> is
       run.

       For messages in <i>dir</i><b>/mod/pending/</b> no  action  is  taken  on
       read-only  files.  Messages  without the owner execute bit
       set are silently removed, as they are the result of incom-
       plete  <b><A HREF="ezmlm-store.1.html">ezmlm-store(1)</A></b>  executions.  For  other messages, a
       notification of the time out is sent to the sender, before
       the file is removed.

       <b>ezmlm-clean</b>  logs  errors  to  the  mail log.  Re-delivery
       should be avoided by suffixing any  <i>.qmail</i>  line  invoking
       <b>ezmlm-clean</b> with '|| exit 0'.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
       <b>-m</b>     (Default.)   The  timed-out  post is sent as a MIME
              enclosure.

       <b>-M</b>     The timed-out post is appended to the message.

       <b>-r</b>     (Default.)   The  timed-out  post  is  returned  to
              sender.

       <b>-R</b>     The  timed-out  post  is  discarded  without sender

                                                                1

ezmlm-clean(1)                                     ezmlm-clean(1)

              notification.  <b>Note:</b> <b>ezmlm-clean</b>  is  normally  run
              from  both  <i>dir</i><b>/editor</b>  and <i>dir</i><b>/moderator</b>.  To sup-
              press sender notification, the switch needs  to  be
              specified for all invocations of <b>ezmlm-clean</b>.

       <b>-v</b>     Display <b>ezmlm-clean</b> version information.

       <b>-V</b>     Display <b>ezmlm-clean</b> version information.

<H2>CHARACTER SETS</H2>
       If  <i>dir</i><b>/charset</b> exists, <b>ezmlm-clean</b> will use the character
       set listed for all messages. Otherwise, the default  ``us-
       ascii'' will be used. The character set can be suffixed by
       ``:'' followed by a code. If the code is  ``Q'',  outgoing
       messages  are sent as ``Quoted-Printable'', if it is ``B''
       they are sent ``base64'' encoded.  Otherwise, text is sent
       as is.
