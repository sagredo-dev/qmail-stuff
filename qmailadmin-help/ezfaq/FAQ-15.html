<H2><A NAME="s15">15. Migration to Ezmlm from other Mailing List Managers.</A></H2>

<P>This section describes differences and similarities between ezmlm and other
mailing list managers. It also details functions of ezmlm-idx that allow
you to configure ezmlm to respond to commands utilized by such other mailing
list managers so the command syntax will be familiar to such users. 
Contributions to complete this sections are welcome.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 Basic Concepts.</A>
</H2>

<P>Ezmlm is different from other mailing list managers in that it is
<EM>list-centric</EM> rather than <EM>host-centric</EM>. With a
<EM>list-centric</EM> interface, you address the list directly with
administrative commands. With ezmlm, the command is embedded in the list 
address thus becoming part of it (i.e., the ``command address''.) 
With smartlist, again you address the list, but send all administrative 
commands to the <CODE>list-request</CODE> address. Ezmlm lists can support this 
if you use the <a href="ezmlm-make.1.html">ezmlm-make(1)</a> ``-q'' switch to configure <a href="ezmlm-request.1.html">ezmlm-request(1)</a> 
in <B>DIR/manager</B>.
<P>Other mailing list managers are <EM>host-centric</EM>, i.e.
administrative commands for any list on that particular host are addressed to a
central address such as <CODE>majordomo@host</CODE>, <CODE>listserv@host</CODE>, or
<CODE>listproc@host</CODE>. Then the user is required to place the command in either
the subject header or more commonly in the body text of the message. The
listname has to be included with the command. [<EM>Note:</EM> The above
concept is not universally applicable to all host-centric mailing lists.
While intended to to used in a host-centric manner, many such mailing list
managers also support <CODE>listname-request@host</CODE> addressing. See the
applicable list manger documentation for details. Coverage of this aspect of
other mailing list manager functionality is beyond the scope of this FAQ.]
To make the migration to ezmlm easier, support for a
<EM>host-centric</EM> style mailing list manger is available. This is based on
the use of <a href="ezmlm-request.1.html">ezmlm-request(1)</a> with the ``-f <B>config_file</B>'' switch.

<H2><A NAME="ezdomo"></A> <A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 Setting up ezmlm to respond to host-centric commands.</A>
</H2>

<P><a href="ezmlm-request.1.html">ezmlm-request(1)</a> can be used a a ``majordomo/listserv-emulator''. You can
create the necessary accessory files manually. However, ezmlm-idx&gt;=0.32
contains <a href="ezmlmglrc.5.html">ezmlmglrc(5)</a> which makes is very easy for you:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % su
        # su alias
        # ezmlm-make -C/usr/local/bin/ezmlmglrc dir dot local host
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where ``local'' may be e.g. ``majordomo''. Even easier is to set it up under
a virtual domain ``host'' controlled by a user ``user''. Just put ``user''
in place of ``alias'' in the example.
<P>If you use a character set other than US-ASCII, put it's name, optionally
followed by ``:'' and the desired content-transfer-encoding character (``Q'' for
quoted-printable and ``B'' for base64) into <B>ezdomo/charset</B>.
<P>All that remains is to set up <B>DIR/ezdomo.cf</B> with information on the
lists (local and/or remote) that you want to make accessible via this
interface. Another script, <a href="ezmlm-glconf.1.html">ezmlm-glconf(1)</a> can help you with this for
your local lists. To configure for all your lists:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        ezmlm-glmake ~/ > ~/dir/ezdomo.cf
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

See man page for details. Alternatively, do it manually:
<P>The <B>DIR/ezdomo.cf</B> contains a list of mailing lists which
the ``majordomo'' (in this case) can provide information about
in the following syntax:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  list@host:listdir:description
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

To show a list in ``lists'', but not include it in a ``which''
search,
simply omit the ``listdir''
for that line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  list@host::description
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For the ``which'' command to work, the <B>DIR/</B>, which contains
the subscriber database, must be readable by the user under which mail
is delivered. This means that ``which'' is usually limited to lists
owned by the user or virtual domain under which the ``ezdomo'' interface
is set up.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 Commands of other mailinglist managers recognized by ezmlm.</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Listproc/Listserv.</H3>

<P>When set up as above, substituting ``listproc'' or ``listserv'' for
``majordomo'' as appropriate, ezmlm will recognize and respond to the
following commands placed in the body of the e-mail with the syntax below.
<B>Note: ezmlm will only respond to one command per message.</B>
<P><B>syntax: command listname [subscriber@host]</B>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Supported commands</B><DD><P>subscribe, sub, unsubscribe, unsub, list, help, review.
<DT><B>Additional supported commands</B><DD><P>All ezmlm commands, such as ``thread'', ``index'' and ``get'' as well as the
list owner's commands.
</DL>
<P>This interfaced makes information available via command messages to the
appropriate mailing list.
Thus, ``list'' and ``review'' will send a subscriber list only to
remote administrators and only if specifically allowed by the list owner.
<P>
<H3>Majordomo.</H3>

<P><B>syntax: command listname [subscriber@host]</B>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Supported commands</B><DD><P>lists, subscribe, unsubscribe, help, which, who.
<DT><B>Additional supported commands</B><DD><P>All ezmlm user and ezmlm owner commands.
</DL>
<P>This interfaced makes information available via command messages to the
appropriate mailing list.
Thus, ``who'' will send a subscriber list only to
remote administrators and only if specifically allowed by the list owner.
<P>
<H3>Smartlist.</H3>

<P>Unlike ``listproc/listserv'' or ``majordomo'', ``smart-list'' does not
provide ``host-centric'' services. Rather, commands are addressed to
<CODE>listname-request@host</CODE> and the command placed
on the ``Subject:'' line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  To: listname-request@host
  Subject: command [subscriber@host]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The body of the message is normally ignored.
If the subject is empty, the first body line that starts with a letter is
interpreted.
<P>

<DT><B>Supported commands</B><DD><P>subscribe, unsubscribe.
<DT><B>Additional Supported Commands</B><DD><P>All ezmlm user and ezmlm owner commands.
