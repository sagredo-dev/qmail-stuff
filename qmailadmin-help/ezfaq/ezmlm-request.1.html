ezmlm-request(1)                                 ezmlm-request(1)

<H2>NAME</H2>
       ezmlm-request  -  Process subject line and body ezmlm com-
       mands

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-request</b> [ <b>-f</b> <i>config</i> ] <i>dir</i>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-request</b> processes ezmlm commands in the subject line
       or message body.  <b>ezmlm-request</b> enables these uses to send
       the message to <i>list</i><b>-request</b><i>@host</i> with the complete command
       address  line  in  the subject field, or with commands and
       arguments separated by white  space.   <b>ezmlm-request</b>  uses
       the text to construct a ezmlm command message to the list.
       If the subject does not start with a letter, <b>ezmlm-request</b>
       instead  uses  the first body line that starts with a let-
       ter. Processing terminates if a line with a hyphen in  the
       first position is encountered.

       All  commands  are expected to be in ezmlm command address
       format or formatted as:

       <b>command</b>[list@listhost<b>[user@userhost]]</b>

       <b>ezmlm-request</b> when invoked with the <b>-f</b> switch and  a  con-
       figuration  file (see below), ignores the subject and pro-
       cesses the first body line (per rules above)  in  conjunc-
       tion  with  the  configuration  file. It also services the
       <b>lists</b> and <b>which</b> commands. This can be used to construct  a
       global  list interface, similar to that used by some other
       mailing list managers.

       Messages at the <i>list</i><b>-request</b><i>@host</i> are  restricted  to  the
       local list. When <b>ezmlm-request</b> is invoked with the <b>-f</b> <i>con-</i>
       <i>fig</i> switch, command messages are limited to lists in  <i>con-</i>
       <i>fig</i> or at the local host.

       Invalid requests for an existing ezmlm list will lead to a
       ``help'' message from <b><A HREF="ezmlm-manage.1.html">ezmlm-manage(1)</A></b>.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>
       <b>-f</b> <i>config</i>
              Function as a global interface to  ezmlm  lists  in
              accordance  with  <i>config.</i>   This  file  consists of
              lines  starting  in   the   first   position   with
              ``list@host:listdir:description''.  Lines  that are
              blank or start
               with ``#'' are ignored. ``listdir'' and ``descrip-
              tion''  are  optional.  If  only  ``list@host''  is
              given, the list is used to restrict  commands  (see
              below),  but  not  listed.  To allow the list to be
              shown by a ``list'' command, use ``list@host:''. To
              specify  only  the  list  name and description, use
              ``list@host::description''.   If   ``listdir''   is

                                                                1

ezmlm-request(1)                                 ezmlm-request(1)

              present, the <b>which</b> command attempts to determine if
              the user is a subscriber of the list.   <b>NOTE:</b>  this
              will  work  only  if the user running <b>ezmlm-request</b>
              has read access to the lists subscriber database.

              If ``listhost''  is  not  specified,  <b>ezmlm-request</b>
              will  use  the  ``listhost''  from the first <i>config</i>
              entry matching ``listlocal''.  If  ``listhost''  is
              specified,  but  not  found in <i>config</i>, it is set to
              the contents of <i>dir</i><b>/outhost</b>.

<H2>USAGE</H2>
       Place an invocation of <b>ezmlm-request</b> in  <i>dir</i><b>/manager</b>  any-
       where before the <b><A HREF="ezmlm-manage.1.html">ezmlm-manage(1)</A></b> line.

       Alternatively,  set  up  <i>dir</i><b>/request</b> with an invocation of
       <b>ezmlm-request</b>.  Make a link from <i>~/.qmail-list-request</i>  to
       this file.

       For  the  global  interface,  place <b>/path/ezmlm-request</b> <b>-f</b>
       <i>config</i> <i>dir</i> into a file.  Link <i>~/.qmail-ezmlm</i> and <i>~/.qmail-</i>
       <i>ezmlm-default</i>  to  this  file.  The  latter  allows <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>request</b> to handle its own bounces as well as to  reply  to
       messages  to  e.g.  ``user-ezmlm-lists@listhost''.  Create
       <i>dir</i><b>/inlocal</b> and <i>dir</i><b>/outlocal</b> with ``user-ezmlm'', <i>dir</i><b>/out-</b>
       <b>host</b>  with  ``listhost'', <i>dir</i><b>/headerremove</b> with headers to
       be   stripped   (copy   from   a   list),   <i>dir/text</i><b>/help</b>,
       <i>dir/text</i><b>/top</b>,  and  <i>dir/text</i><b>/bottom</b>  with  the appropriate
       texts.  Also, create <i>config</i> with the appropriate contents.

       Mail  to  ``user-ezmlm@listhost''  will now be answered by
       <b>ezmlm-request</b>.

<H2>RECOGNIZED COMMANDS</H2>
       Any command not recognized by <b>ezmlm-request</b> is assumed  to
       be valid, as long as it consists of only letters, numbers,
       hyphen, underscore, period, and ``+''. This allows  <b>ezmlm-</b>
       <b>request</b>  to  correctly  handle  commands added by the list
       owner.

       A number of commands are recognized by  <b>ezmlm-request</b>  but
       not  processed.  Instead  they  are mapped to <b>help</b> without
       arguments. These are: <b>system</b>, <b>put</b>, and <b>set</b>.

       <b>ezmlm-request</b> also handles a number of aliases  for  ezmlm
       commands.  Since  <b>ezmlm-request</b> only passes on requests to
       the list, local restrictions  apply.   For  commands  that
       have aliases, accepted aliases are listed:

       <b>subscribe</b>
              sub

       <b>unsubscribe</b>
              unsub, signoff, remove.

                                                                2

ezmlm-request(1)                                 ezmlm-request(1)

       <b>index</b>  ind.

       <b>list</b>   recipients, showdist, review, rev, who.

       Some  commands  are  handled  differently when used
              without argu- ments:

       <b>query</b>  Treated like ``which''.

       <b>list</b>   Treated like ``lists''.

<H2>BUGS</H2>
       <b>ezmlm-request</b>  places  stricter  requirements on addresses
       than rfc822. Thus, some addresses that are  rfc822-compli-
       ant  cannot be used as <b>ezmlm-request</b> command arguments. If
       you   fix   this,   please   send   a   patch   to   lind-
       berg@id.wustl.edu. I think qmail has the same restriction,
       though.

       <b>ezmlm-request</b> uses NUL as a  line  terminator  internally.
       Thus,  if  will  fail  if  NUL is found within the line it
       tries to interpret as a command.  It  is  harmless,  other
       than that the remainder of the line will be ignored.

       The <b>ezmlm-request</b> ``which'' command does not differentiate
       between a list for which the command is not  available,  a
       list  for which the subscriber db is not accessible, and a
       list for which the  address  is  not  a  subscriber.  This
       should be considered a feature.
