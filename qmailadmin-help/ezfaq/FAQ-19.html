<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss19.1">19.1 Command names.</A>
</H2>

<P>ezmlm commands can have aliases for use in translations for 
non-English use.
Due to the use of commands in mail e-mail addresses, the character set is
limited by rfc822 to us-ascii. To enable the command aliases, remove the
comment marks around the INTL_CMDS define in idx.h. Also, remove the
comments from the define corresponding to one language (currently,
only LANG_FR - French) available.
<P>The INTL_CMDS define results in the compilation of all ezmlm programs
with support for alias commands for those commands listed in the INTL
section (all that are used directly by users). All aliases MUST be
defined, but should be the normal English commands. The language-specific
sections un-define and redefine the commands for which alternative names
should be used. This allows use of e.g. ``inscription'' as an alias
in addition to the standard ``subscribe''.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss19.2">19.2 Text files.</A>
</H2>

<P>Most ezmlm responses are made from text files in <B>DIR/text/</B>. These are
created from the template file ``ezmlmrc''. Thanks to Frank Denis,
and Masashi Fujita, Wanderlei Antonio Cavassin, Sergiusz Pawlowicz,
Frank Tegtmeyer, Torben Fjerdingstad, Jan Kasprzak, and Sebastian Andersson,
French, Japanese, Portuguese (var. Brazil), Polish, German, Danish, Czech,
and Swedish
versions are available. Just:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % make jp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

before
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        # make setup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

or just copy <B>ezmlmrc.jp</B> to <B>/etc/ezmlmrc</B>,
where it will override the
copy installed in the ezmlm binary directory. For rpm packages, the en_US
version is installed, but the other versions are available in the
<B>/usr/doc/</B> hierarchy.
<P>If you have made an <B><a href="ezmlmrc.5.html">ezmlmrc(5)</a></B>
version for another language, please make it public domain and E-mail it
as an attachment to <CODE>lindberg@id.wustl.edu</CODE>. It will then be put into
the <B>ezmlmrc</B> directory of the distribution site. Please take
advantage of the ``Content-transfer-encoding'' capability of ezmlm-idx&gt;=0.30,
if needed, as this avoids problems when messages are sent via non-8-bit
MUAs.
<P>Other ezmlm responses, such as words in subject lines, are defines in
<B>idx.h</B> and can be changed there. Error messages should ideally not be
altered. However, it may make sense to change a few of them which are
used as messages to e.g. remote administrators. The defines for all
error messages are in <B>errtxt.h</B>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss19.3">19.3 Multi-byte character code support.</A>
</H2>

<P>ezmlm, as far as we know, places no restrictions on character
sets. The configurable default character set allows you to use
other character sets for out going ezmlm messages. ezmlm-make
does not <EM>per se</EM> support other character sets. However, any
single-byte character set is supported, as long as the us-ascii
character sequence ``&lt;/'' does not occur anywhere as the
first characters of the line, and the character sequence
``&lt;#x#&gt;'' (where ``x'' is any number, or
A, B, C, D, F, H, L, R, T) does
not occur anywhere is text (if it does, it risks being
substituted). Also, any occurrence or ``&lt;#A#&gt;''
and ``&lt;#R#&gt;'' that
is the first on any text line will be substituted by ezmlm-manage
and ezmlm-store. Any occurrence of ``!A'' and ``!R'' as the
first characters on a line will be substituted by ezmlm-manage
and ezmlm-store.
<P>For multi-byte character codes, the same restrictions apply.
Thus, ``&lt;/'' at the start of a line will confuse ezmlm-make, and
any ``&lt;#x#&gt;'' sequence within the text risks substitution. In
practice, both of these should be very rare and easily
avoidable when setting up an <a href="ezmlmrc.5.html">ezmlmrc(5)</a>.
