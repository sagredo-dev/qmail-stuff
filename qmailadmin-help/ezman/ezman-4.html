</H2>

<P>ezmlm is a mailing list manager written
by Dan J. Bernstein. ezmlm-idx
is an extension to ezmlm written by Frederik P. Lindberg. ezmlm has
the essential features of a mailing list manager. ezmlm-idx adds useful, but
non-essential features like digests, list moderation, etc. The list owner will
have made the trade off of features vs. increased size and complexity.
To test if your list has ezmlm-idx installed, send a message to
<CODE>list-get@host</CODE> where ``list@host'' is the name of the list. A list
with ezmlm alone will send you a help message saying that your message
wasn't sent to one of its command addresses. A list with ezmlm-idx will
return one or more messages from the archive, or a message telling you
that the list is not archived.
Throughout
this manual, features available only with ezmlm-idx are marked with ``(*)''.
<P>For more technical information about ezmlm, it's options, and error resolution,
please read the FAQ (
<A HREF="http://www.ezmlm.org/">http://www.ezmlm.org/</A>)
and the ezmlm man pages. A text version of the FAQ is included in the
ezmlm-idx distribution. The latest FAQ in various formats can be found at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.id.wustl.edu/pub/patches/">ftp://ftp.id.wustl.edu/pub/patches/</A> or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ezmlm.org/pub/patches/">ftp://ftp.ezmlm.org/pub/patches/</A>.
The FAQ also contains information on where to obtain ezmlm, where to find
mailing lists about ezmlm, etc. While it is called a ``FAQ'', the document
will with time become the ezmlm/idx technical manual. The man pages are
always installed with ezmlm. To read the man page for ezmlm, do:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % man ezmlm
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

To read the man page for ezmlm-make, do:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % man ezmlm-make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Also, take a look at Dan J. Bernstein's pages on ezmlm and other programs
he has written at
<A HREF="http://www.pobox.com/~djb/">http://www.pobox.com/~djb/</A>
and the qmail home page at

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 More about this document.</A>
</H2>

<P>This document is updated for ezmlm-0.53 and ezmlm-idx-0.32. It is available
at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.id.wustl.edu/pub/patches/ezman/">ftp://ftp.id.wustl.edu/pub/patches/ezman/</A>
as ``ezman-x.xx.format[.tar].gz''. ``x.xx'' is the version, ``format''
is the format, e.g. ``ps'', and ``.tar'' is present if the document consists
of several files. ezmlm-idx versions have a 2 digit minor version number,
with a third digit added for bug fixes (no new features).
Thus, 0.314 is the forth bug fix
release of 0.31. Manuals and FAQ follow a similar convention with the first
two digits matching the version of the package. Thus, you should always get
the documentation matching the first two digits (``xx'' in ``0.xxy''),
and there chose the highest ``y'' available.
<P>This document comes with absolutely no warranties.
If there are errors or omissions in this manual, please send
corrections/comments to the author. The manual is intended to be complete
for users and moderators/administrators. For list owners, it is intended
more as a summary and introduction to the FAQ.
