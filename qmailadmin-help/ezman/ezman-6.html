<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Emulating other mailing list managers(*).</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Global ezmlm commands (majordomo, listserv, listproc).</A>
</H2>

<P>These mailing list managers use a central address. The command is in the
message body.
The ezmlm-reject(1) (*)
program can be configured to answer request at a standard
address of a computer.
Usually, ''<CODE>listserv@host</CODE>'' or ''<CODE>majordomo@host</CODE>''
will be used. Here, ezmlm-request
understands most basic commands of other mailing list
managers, as long as the functionality is relevant to ezmlm.
<P>ezmlm will interpret
the first line of the message body
as a command (to emulate other mailing list managers). You need to
send one message per command.
The command ``<EM>lists</EM>'' will give you a list of available mailing lists
with a short description. The command ``<EM>which</EM>'' will tell you which
lists you are subscribed to. This will work <B>only</B> for list configured
by the system administrator. Naturally, you can use the ``ezmlm way'' to
put the commands into the address with a message to e.g.
<CODE>listserv-lists@host</CODE>.
<P>You can send basic commands for most mailing list managers to this address.
ezmlm will translate them into command messages to the individual lists.
If only the local name
of the list is specified, ezmlm will find the host part in its configured list.
For instance ``<EM>subscribe fishing</EM>''
will subscribe you to the <CODE>fishing@wildlife.org</CODE> list, assuming that
that list was in the reply to the ``<EM>lists</EM>'' command.
<P>Please see the ezmlm FAQ and ezmlm-request(1) and ezmlmglrc(5)
man pages for more information
on how to set up and use this interface.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Commands at the <CODE>list-request</CODE> address (smartlist).</A>
</H2>

<P>If the ezmlm-make ``-q'' switch is used to set up/edit the list, ezmlm-make
configures ezmlm-request(1) to answer the <CODE>list-request@host</CODE>
address. If a subject is given, it will be interpreted as a command. See
FAQ and the ezmlm-request(1) man page for more info.
