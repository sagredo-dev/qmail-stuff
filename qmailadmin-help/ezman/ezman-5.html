<H2><A NAME="s5">5. ezmlm Commands</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Commands available to users.</A>
</H2>

<P>To use a command on the mailing list <CODE>ml@host.org</CODE>, send a message
to <CODE>ml-command@host.org</CODE>. For commands affecting an address database,
you can add ''-target=targethost.dom'' after ``command'' to apply the command to
<CODE>target@targethost.dom</CODE> instead of to the address your sending from.
This works for all commands related to subscriber databases,
<EM>-faq</EM>(*), <EM>-help</EM>, and <EM>-info</EM>(*). It does not work for
archive retrieval commands. For the archive access commands, you may instead
add arguments consisting
of a message number or range of message numbers after the
command
<BLOCKQUOTE>Features available only if ezmlm-idx is used are marked ``(*)''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>-faq(*)</B><DD><P>Send a list of frequently asked questions and answers specific for this list.
<DT><B>-get</B><DD><P>Get a message or range of messages from the archive. Without argument it returns
the messages since the latest digest.
To retrieve a range of messages, use <CODE>list-get.123_234@host</CODE>(*).
At most 100 messages are returned.
Without ezmlm-idx, individual messages can still be retrieved by sending
mail to <CODE>list-get.123@host</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><B>-help</B><DD><P>Returns general command help for the list.
<DT><B>-index(*)</B><DD><P>Returns a subject/author index for the messages. Without arguments, the entries
for at least the latest 100 messages is returned.
At most 2000 entries are returned per request.
<DT><B>-info(*)</B><DD><P>Return information about this list.
<DT><B>-query(*)</B><DD><P>Tells you if your address (or the target address) is a subscriber or not. It's
always returned to the address in question, so it cannot be used to determine
the subscriber status of others.
You can also use <CODE>list-query-user=userhost@listhost</CODE>,
where ``list@listhost'' is
the address of the list and ``user@userhost'' is the address that should
be tested. The reply is sent to that address, so you can't use this to
test the subscriber status of addresses that you do not control.
<DT><B>-subscribe</B><DD><P>Add the target (your) address to the subscriber list.
The address will receive a confirmation request.
<DT><B>-thread(*)</B><DD><P>Return the thread containing the message number given as the argument.
The argument is required.
<DT><B>-unsubscribe</B><DD><P>Remove the target (your) address from the subscriber list.
The address will receive a confirmation request.
You can also use <CODE>list-unsubscribe-user=userhost@listhost</CODE>,
where ``list@listhost'' is
the address of the list and ``user@userhost'' is the address that should
be removed from the subscriber database3.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Additional commands that may be available to remote administrators(*)</A>
</H2>

<P>These commands are only available to remote administrators. They need to
be explicitly enabled, i.e. they are disabled by default, even for remote
administrators. Anyone can send these commands, but they are allowed only
if the recipient is a remote administrator. Thus, if <CODE>address@addhost</CODE>
sends a message to <CODE>mailinglist-list-mod=modhost@example.org</CODE>, ezmlm will
reply with a subscriber list to <CODE>mod@modhost</CODE> if this address is a
remote administrator, and if the list is configured for remote
subscriber listing.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>-edit(*)</B><DD><P>Edit ezmlm text files via E-mail. <EM>-edit.file</EM>
returns <B>DIR/text/fn</B> for editing, where any underscore (``_'')
in ``file'' is replaced by a hyphen (``-'') in ``fn''.
<DT><B>-list(*)</B><DD><P>Retrieve a list of subscriber addresses.
<DT><B>-log(*)</B><DD><P>Retrieve the subscription log. <EM>-log.xxx</EM> returns only lines
matching ``xxx'' in a case-insensitive search with ``_'' as a wild card.
a list of subscriber addresses.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Command extensions for ezmlm address databases(*)</A>
</H2>

<P>ezmlm commands that manipulate address collections can be used on addresses
other than the list subscribers. To apply a command to another collection,
send mail to <CODE>ml-extension-command@host.org</CODE> or
<CODE>ml-extension-command-target=targethost.dom@host.org</CODE>.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>(none)</B><DD><P><CODE>ml-command@host.org</CODE> affects subscribers of the main list.
<DT><B>digest(*)</B><DD><P>Affects subscribers of the digest list.
<DT><B>allow(*)</B><DD><P>Affects addresses that are allowed to post or retrieve messages from the
archive without necessarily being subscribers. By default, anyone may post
to the list or retrieve archived messages, so this address database is
without effect. It is very useful when posts and access is allowed to
subscribers only, since some users may send from addresses other than their
subscriber addresses.
<DT><B>deny(*)</B><DD><P>These addresses are prevented from posting.
Accessible only to remote administrators an only if configured (by default,
this address list is not used). It is usually used to decrease the impact
or errant mail robots rather than to attempt to prevent certain addresses from
posting. These addresses never affect archive access.
