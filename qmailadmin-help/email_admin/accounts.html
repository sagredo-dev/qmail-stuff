<h2><a name="accounts"></a>Accounts </h2>
<p>This are some basic comments on accounts and some special notes on certan accounts.</p>
<h3><a name="postmaster_account"></a>The Postmaster Account</h3>
<p>The postmaster account is used as the account for administering the domain 
  using QmailAdmin. It is suggested that if you are not going to be using the 
  postmaster account as a regular account you create and alias or forward to a 
  valid account. This account is used by other administrators to get in touch 
  with the domain admin if there are any problems. The system administrator may 
  also use this account to get in touch with you so it should be valid and working.</p>
<h3><a name="special_accounts"></a>Other Special Accounts</h3>
<p>There are a number of other account that could also be creates as needed these 
  include accounts such as the webmaster (for listing on webpages).</p>
<h3><a name="sub_accounts"></a>Sub Accounts</h3>
<p>One excellent feature of our mail system is that it support sub accounts. This 
  means that if you are user bob@smith.com and you want to give out different 
  email addresses for different things (websites, other mailing lists, etc.) you 
  can give out bob-anythingyoucanthinkof@smith.com or bob-anything-you-can-think-of@smith.com 
  and they will be delivered to andbob@smith.com. This is an excellent feature 
  if used with a system list spamcop. This way a user can give out an account 
  like user-spam@domain.com when reporting spam via <a href="http://www.spamcop.net/">spamcop.net</a> 
  and if this account gets added to a number of mailing lists the user can contact 
  the system administrator and they can have the -spam subaccount blocked and 
  they user can change subaccounts.</p>
