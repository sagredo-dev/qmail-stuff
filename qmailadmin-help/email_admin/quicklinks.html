<p><span class="reference">POP ACCOUNT</span><b>: </b>To create a new pop account, 
  enter in a mailbox name. The mailbox name can be from 1 to 128 characters in 
  length. Use letters and numbers and the dash. Do not use any other special characters 
  or you may have problems checking the email account with certain email programs 
  like Netscape, Eudora, Outlook Express, and others. Do not include the trailing 
  @yourdomain.com part. </p>
<p>Examples of valid POP account names:</p>

    <td class="data">This enables/disables message moderation for standard posting 
      to the mailing list. This flag is required for the following options to 
      work: (-o). It is recommended that this be left as non-moderated unless 
      you are building an outgoing mailing list with the -o option or are concerned 
      about what will be posted to the link. With moderation enabled all posting 
      will first be sent to the moderator(s) and they will need to approve the 
      emai before it is actually posted to the list.</td>

    <td class="data">Archived (-a)<span class="reference"> [default]</span></td>
    <td class="data">Not archived (-A)</td>
    <td class="data">Enables/disables message archiving. Archives can be retrieved 
      using email based -get command (access it controlled by -b and -g options) 
      or via a web interface if the -i option is enabled. Archiving is a nice 
      feature for most mailing lists so that new members can read what was discussed 
      in the past. Access to the archives via email is controlled by the -b option 
      below.</td>

      archive. (-b)</td>

      on the Guard setting. (-B) <span class="reference">[default]</span></td>
    <td class="data">Controls who can request the message archives using the get 
      comnmand. If block archives in set (-b) only the moderator(s) of the mailing 
      list can access the archives. If block is not set then the guard setting 
      (-g) is used to determine if a non-moderator can access the archives. For 
      most lists non-blocking (-B) is appropriate but if you wish the archives 
      to be built but not accessed by most users set the list to be blocking (-b).</td>

    <td class="data">No digest. Do not set up the digest list. (-D)<span class="reference"> 
      [default]</span></td>
    <td class="data">Enable/disable list digests. Digests are daily (sometimes 
      more frequent based on volume) bundles of messages sent to a list. If a 
      user does not want to receive the emails on an individual basis (because 
      they just want to read them - they don't ever plan to reply) they may wish 
      to receive the daily digest of the discussions for the day. For most lists 
      a digest is unneccasary. The system administrator can enable this later 
      if users request it.</td>

    <td class="data">Enable/disable message prefixes. This enables or disables 
      the addition of a prefix to the subject of each message sent via the list. 
      This is not recommended as a mailing list should not be changing the subject 
      and this may interfere with other tags that users place in the subject. 
      This is a good addition however for distribution lists where only the moderator 
      is sending out informational message and the users do not post to the list 
      (-m with -o)</td>

      will be serviced. (-G)</td>
    <td class="data">This setting controls who can request the message archives 
      with the get command. If the guard is set only subscribers can request the 
      archives. If it is not set anyone can request the archives as long as they 
      know the mailing list address. Note that this is not entirely secure as 
      it is easy to fool the email system into believing the correct SENDER was 
      sent. This setting is only valid if archives are enabled (-a) and they are 
      not blocked (-B).</td>

    <td class="data">Enables/disables an archive index used for viewing the archives

<h4>Some Example Mailing List Configurations</h4>
<p>Below are some possible configurations for a mailing list.</p>
<h5>General Discussion List - Public</h5>
<p>This type of list is very common. In this setup the following is done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>posting to the list is limited to subsribers but is not moderated.</li>
  <li>Subscriptions are not moderated so anyone can subscribe.</li>
  <li>The moderators are given full remote rights.</li>
  <li>Archives are created with web based indexes. They are also publicly accessible.</li>
  <li>The digest mode is enable for those that would like to use it.</li>
  <li>The trailer is enabled (and can be edited by the moderators)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to setup this list the following setting flags are used (as detailed 
  above):</p>
<ul>
  <li>M a B d F G H i J l n O p q r S t u</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>General Discussion List - Private</h5>
<p>This type of list is also very common for groups that wish to have private 
  conversations (like executives). In this setup the following is done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>posting to the list is limited to subsribers but non-subscriber email are 
    sent to the moderator for confirmation.</li>
  <li>Subscriptions are moderated so the subscription list is controlled.</li>
  <li>The moderators are given full remote rights.</li>
  <li>Archives are created with web based indexes. They are only available to 
    subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to setup this list the following setting flags are used (as detailed 
  above):</p>
<ul>
  <li>m a B D F g H i J l n O p q r S T u</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Distribution List (Moderators post only)</h5>
<p>This type of list is intended as a distribution only list, possibly for updates 
  or announcements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>posting to the list is limited to moderators.</li>
  <li>Subscribing is not limited so anyone can subscribe.</li>
  <li>The moderators are given full remote rights.</li>
  <li>Archives are created with web based indexes. They are only available to 
    subscribers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to setup this list the following setting flags are used (as detailed 
  above):</p>
<ul>
  <li>m a B D F g H i J l n o p q r S t u</li>
</ul>
<h4>A Note About Moderators</h4>
<p>Even if the being created is not being moderated for postings it is a good 
  idea to add a moderator in the event that you have configured the subscribers 
  to be moderated or non-subscriber postings to be moderated. It may also be desirable 
  to have a moderator setup simply to edit some of the text files for the mailing 
  list. This includes the mailing list list trailer (if enabled).</p>
