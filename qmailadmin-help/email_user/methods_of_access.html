<h2><a name="methods_of_access"></a>Methods of Access</h2>
<p>There are three possible ways to access you email: Webmail, POP and IMAP. All 
  three of these methods can be used at the same time and you can switch back 
  and further between them if you so choose.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="pop3"></a>POP3</h3>
<p>POP was designed to support &quot;offline&quot; mail processing. In the offline 
  paradigm, mail is delivered to a (usually shared) server, and a personal computer 
  user periodically invokes a mail &quot;client&quot; program that connects to 
  the server and downloads all of the pending mail to the user's own machine. 
  Thereafter, all mail processing is local to the client machine. Think of the 
  offline access mode as a kind of store-and-forward service, intended to move 
  mail (on demand) from the mail server (drop point) to a single destination machine, 
  usually a PC or Mac. Once delivered to the PC or Mac, the messages are then 
  deleted from the mail server. Although the limitations of offline access have 
  triggered interest in using POP in online mode, POP simply doesn't have some 
  of the functionality needed for high-quality online (or disconnected) operation. 
  Indeed, POP's &quot;pseudo online&quot; mode of operation, wherein client programs 
  leave mail on the server, often depends on pervasive availability of a remote 
  file system protocol in order for the mail client to access or update saved-message 
  folders or message state information such as status flags.</p>
<p>POP is the older standard for downloading mail and our mail server supports 
  it. It should be noted that if mail is download and removed from the server 
  it will not be present when checked again using IMAP or Webmail.</p>
<p>When configuring you email client on your computer to check your email on the 
  server you need to use the following settings:</p>
<p><span class="reference">username:</span> &lt;full_email_address@including_domain&gt;<br>
  <span class="reference">password: </span>&lt;as given&gt;<br>
  <span class="reference">hostname: &lt;domain&gt;</span></p>
<p>Note that the username used to access your email is your full email address 
  as given to you by the administrator.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="imap"></a>IMAP</h3>
<p>IMAP can also do offline processing, but its special strength is in online 
  and disconnected operation. In online mode, mail is again delivered to a shared 
  server, but the mail client does not copy it all at once and then delete it 
  from the server. It's more of an interactive client-server model, where the 
  client can ask the server for headers, or the bodies of specified messages, 
  or to search for messages meeting certain criteria. Messages in the mail repository 
  can be marked with various status flags (e.g. &quot;deleted&quot; or &quot;answered&quot;) 
  and they stay in the repository until explicitly removed by the user --which 
  may not be until a later session. In short: IMAP is designed to permit manipulation 
  of remote mailboxes as if they were local. Depending on the IMAP client implementation 
  and the mail architecture desired by the system manager, the user may save messages 
  directly on the client machine, or save them on the server, or be given the 
  choice of doing either.</p>
<p>IMAP is a more flexible mail protocol in that is allows the user to maintain 
  their email on the server. This means that a user who uses IMAP to look at their 
  email from their mail client may then use the Webmail tool to access that same 
  email when they are not at their computer.</p>
<p>When configuring you email client on your computer to check your email on the 
  server you need to use the following settings:</p>
<p><span class="reference">username:</span> &lt;full_email_address@including_domain&gt;<br>
  <span class="reference">password: </span>&lt;as given&gt;<br>
  <span class="reference">hostname: &lt;domain&gt;</span></p>
<p>Note that the username used to access your email is your full email address 
  as given to you by the administrator.<br>
  If prompted for a root directory name use INBOX.</p>
