qmail-spp 0.42 - Release Notes
Pawel Foremski <pjf@asn.pl>, April 7th 2006


Hi, this is next brand new qmail-spp release fixing small bug and introducing
new minor feature.

The ChangeLog says it all:

  * fixed bug in qmail-smtpd.c where SMTPRCPTHOSTSOK was not set properly
    if RELAYCLIENT env var was set (authenticated client / tcprules);
    thanks for Roberto Alsina (ralsina /at/ kde \dot\ org) for bugreport

  * added SMTPRCPTCOUNTALL env var which also counts rejected RCPT
    commands; thanks for Michael Handler for suggestion
