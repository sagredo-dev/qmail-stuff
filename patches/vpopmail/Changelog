- defauldelivery patch: .qmail file won't be created if control/defaultdelivery already has vdelivermail.

Oct 13, 2023
- added "s/qmail cdb" patch
  it allows vpopmail to locate correctly the qmail assign.cdb for s/qmail users

Sep 5, 2023
- changed configuration option --enable-logging=e (was p). Now failed attempts will be logged with no password shown.

Aug 27, 2023
- the logic of the defaultdelivery patch/feature has been revised. if configured with --enable-defauldelivery
  vpopmail will save control/defauldelivery in the user's .qmail and vdelivermail LDA in the domain's
  .qmail-default file. This will achieve multiple benefit: you have qmail forwards and sieve together and
  valias available. The valias table scheme was changed as well.

Feb 18, 2023
- Added a patch to fix the following issues (tx Ali Erturk TURKER):
  1- vdelivermail.c checks spamassassin permissions, instead of maildrop permissions.
  2- vopen_smtp_relay() return values corrected, so that open_smtp_relay() can detect and report database connection errors (vmysql.c, voracle.pc, vpgsql.c )
  3- vdel_limits() core-dumps if a database connection is not available beforehand. (vmysql.c, voracle.pc )

- fixed a compilation break in vmysql.c with Debian 11 / gcc-10

Oct 30, 2021
- fixed a compilation break in vrcptcheck.c caused by a missing link to direntry.h. It's now linked to dirent.h.
  (tx Wouter De Geus)

Oct 29, 2021
- vusaged-configure patch added
  solves a configure break that I've seen on a debian 11, provided that the configure file is rebuilt with:
  autoreconf -f -i

Sep 23, 2021
- recipient check patch added
  It is a recipient check for e.h. s/qmail. look ar doc/README.vrcptcheck for more info

July 8, 2021
- minor fixes to the dovecot-pwd_query patch

April 18, 2021
- code cleanup

March 27, 2021
- bug fixes in the defaultdelivery patch: increased the buffer for the .qmail-default file path, as in particular cases of long path/domain names it will result truncated. Fixed another bug where the .qmail.default file where opened twice.
- now if vdelivermail is installed the "delete" option will be used instead of "bounce-no-mailbox", which is not reasonable anymore

March 9, 2021
- the vpopmail patch now installs the sql code needed for "one table per domain" (--disable-many-domains) in ~/vpopmail/etc/pwd-query_disable-many-domains.sql and creates the sql procedure if needed. Of course this add-on to vpopmail will be completely transparent when you compile with the default option --enable-many-domains

March 2, 2021
- added mysql-limits support. See changes in dovecot-sql password_query as well.

February 26, 2021
- added a "defaultdelivery patch" to the package of patches. configure --enable-defaultdelivery to enable it.

February 15, 2021
- fix in the configure file. An autoreconf is needed as I modified the configure.in and Makefile.am files

February 10, 2021
- a C program vsavealiasdomains can now save all the existing domain aliases to MySQL. It can be useful in case of migrations to the dovecot's sql auth driver.

February 5, 2021
- sql-aliasdomains patch added and combined patch released

December 12, 2020
- patch to get vpopmail compatible with gcc-10
