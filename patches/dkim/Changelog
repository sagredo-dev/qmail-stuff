-DKIM patch upgraded to v. 1.46
 * dk-filter.sh has been dropped
 * The ariables USE_FROM, USE_SENDER and DKIMDOMAIN have been dropped
 * when signing at qmail-remote level qmail-dkim now has to be called directly by spawn-filter in the rc file.
   man spawn-filter for more info
 * In case of bounces the signature will be automatically based on the from: field.
   This will solve issues of DMARC reject by google in case of sieve/vacation bounces.
 * In case of ordinary bounces (mailbox not found, for instance) the bounce domain will be taken from
   control/bouncehost and, if doesn't exist, from control/me

- The patch now by default excludes X-Arc-Authentication-Results
- dkim can additionally use the environment variable EXCLUDE_DKIMSIGN to include colon separated list of

  it overrides the value of EXCLUDE_DKIMSIGN.
