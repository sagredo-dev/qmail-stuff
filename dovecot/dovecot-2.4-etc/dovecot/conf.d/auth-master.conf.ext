# Authentication for master users. Included from auth.conf.

# By adding master=yes setting inside a passdb you make the passdb a list
# of "master users", who can log in as anyone else.
# <https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/core/config/auth/master_users.html>

# Example master user passdb using passwd-file. You can use any passdb though.
#passdb master-passwd-file {
#  driver = passwd-file
#  master = yes
#  passwd_file_path = /etc/dovecot/master-users
#}
