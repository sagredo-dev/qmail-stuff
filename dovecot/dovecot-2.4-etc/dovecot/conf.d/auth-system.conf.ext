# Driver is only needed if the section name is not same as driver's name.

# PAM authentication. Preferred nowadays by most systems.
# PAM is typically used with either userdb passwd or userdb static.
# REMEMBER: You'll need /etc/pam.d/dovecot file created for PAM
# authentication to actually work. <https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/core/config/auth/databases/pam.html>

# System users (NSS, /etc/passwd, or similiar).
# In many systems nowadays this uses Name Service Switch, which is
# configured in /etc/nsswitch.conf. <https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/core/config/auth/databases/passwd.html>

#userdb passwd-file {
  #driver = passwd-file
  #auth_username_format=%{user|lower}
  #passwd_file_path = /etc/passwd
  #fields {
  #  user= %{user|lower}
  #  name = %{user|lower}

}

# Static settings generated from template <https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/core/config/auth/databases/static.html>
#userdb static {
  #driver = static
  # Can return anything a userdb could normally return. For example:
  # fields {
  #   uid = 500
  #   gid = 500
  #   home = /var/mail/%{user}
  # }
  # LDA and LMTP needs to look up users only from the userdb. This of course
  # doesn't work with static userdb because there is no list of users.
  # Normally static userdb handles this by doing a passdb lookup. This works
  # with most passdbs, with PAM being the most notable exception. If you do
  # the user verification another way, you can add allow_all_users=yes
  # in which case the passdb lookup is skipped.
  #allow_all_users = yes
